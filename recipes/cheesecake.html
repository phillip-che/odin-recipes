<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A dessert consisting of a thick, creamy filling of cheese, eggs, and sugar over a thinner crust and topped with sweet or sometimes salty items.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>15 Graham Crackers, Crushed</li>
    <li>2 Tablespoons Butter, Melted</li>
    <li>8 Ounces Cream Cheese</li>
    <li>1 1/2 Cups White Sugar</li>
    <li>3/4 Cup Milk</li>
    <li>4 Eggs</li>
    <li>1 Cup Sour Cream</li>
    <li>1 Tablespoon Vanilla Extract</li>
    <li>1/4 Cup All-Purpose Flour</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9 inch springform pan.</li>
    <li>In a medium bowl, mix graham cracker crumbs with melted butter. Press onto bottom of springform pan.</li>
    <li>In a large bowl, mix cream cheese with sugar until smooth. Blend in milk, and then mix in the eggs one at a time, mixing just enough to incorporate. Mix in sour cream, vanilla and flour until smooth. Pour filling into prepared crust.</li>
    <li>Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour. Turn the oven off, and let cake cool in oven with the door closed for 5 to 6 hours; this prevents cracking. Chill in refrigerator until serving.</li>
